# CarGame

This was a college assignment (so between 2014-15) in which the objective was to create an educational game in an object oriented language. I went with a JavaScript game in which you would solve progressively harder maths equations to increase your score, taking heavy inspiration *(as you can probably guess from the atlas)* from the just removed game Flappy Bird.

## How to play

Click the play button or press enter to begin the game. The obstacle coloured red is the equation you must answer by either pressing the answer on your keyboard or clicking the respective number on screen. All answers will be single digit numbers. You have three hearts. A heart will be taken if you hit an obstacle, or if you answer an equation wrongly. The game ends when you run out of hearts. Put `#copter` at the end of the url to get a little easter egg.

## Git History

Sadly the git history, if this ever had one, is lost to time.
